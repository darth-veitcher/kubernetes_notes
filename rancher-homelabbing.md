# Using Rancher + RancherOS for Homelabbing

Sources:

* [Rancher](https://rancher.com)
* [RancherOS](https://rancher.com/rancher-os/)
* [Rancher Kubernetes Engine \(RKE\)](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/v0.1.x/en/)



## Notes

You need to downgrade the Docker engine on RancherOS in order for Kubernetes to work \(ships with 18 at time of writing and k8s only supports 17\).
