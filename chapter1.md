# Tools Available

To deploy a Kubernetes cluster there are multiple tools available:

* Minikube \(local install\)
* Docker Client \(local install\)

Minikube and Docker spin up single node clusters only for development and testing. You would not want these for a production setup.

* Kops
* Kubeadm

Either Kops or Kubeadm can be used for production clusters \(use only one\)
