# Getting started

Locally setup a kubernetes cluster using the `minikube` application which can be found on \[GitHub\]\([https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases\](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases\)\).

Start the local kubernetes cluster using `minikube start`

One started this will have create a local `~/.kube/config` file which allows you to connect to the newly created VM with `kubectl` command.

```
# NB: If you want to use another virtualisation method see
# https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/v0.33.1/README.md#requirements
# The example below starts minikube with VMWare Fusion instead of VirtualBox (default)

```
